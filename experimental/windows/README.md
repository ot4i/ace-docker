# Windows containers

Simple docker images for ACE v12 on Windows, using Windows containers. These containers
will run Windows Server Core, and are not running Linux containers on Windows.

Dockefiles in the following directories are used for various purposes:

- ace-basic can run the product server, including all files except the toolkit.
- ace-sample contains a sample BAR file and Dockerfiles for building runnable images to serve HTTP clients.
