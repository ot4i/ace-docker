# Copy the BAR files into /tmp and process them:
#
# - Each file is compiled to ensure faster server startup
# - The files are unpacked into the server work directory
# - Once all files are in place, the work directory is optimized to speed up server start
# - The contents are made world-writable to allow for random userids at runtime
#
# The results of the commands can be found in the /tmp/deploys file.
